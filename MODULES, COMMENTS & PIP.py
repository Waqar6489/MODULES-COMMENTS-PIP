''' MODULES, COMMENTS & PIP
Let’s write our very first python program. Create a file called hello.py and paste the 
below code in it.
print("hello world") # print is a function (more later)
Execute this file (.py file) by typing python hello.py and you will see Hello World printed 
on the screen.

MODULES:
A module is a file containing code written by somebody else (usually) which can be 
imported and used in our programs.

PIP:
Pip is the package manager for python. You can use pip to install a module on your 
system.
pip install flask # Installs Flask Module

TYPES OF MODULES:
There are two types of modules in Python.
1. Built in Modules (Preinstalled in Python)
2. External Modules (Need to install using pip)
Some examples of built in modules are os, random etc.
Some examples of external modules are tensorflow, flask etc.

USING PYTHON AS A CALCULATOR:
We can use python as a calculator by typing “python” + ↵ on the terminal.
This opens REPL or Read Evaluate Print Loop.

COMMENTS:
Comments are used to write something which the programmer does not want to 
execute. This can be used to mark author name, date etc.

TYPES OF COMMENTS:
There are two types of comments in python.

of the line.

or you can use the multiline string (""" """)
